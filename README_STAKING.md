## Features

### Staking Options
- 1 Month: 10% APY
- 6 Months: 20% APY
- 12 Months: 30% APY

### Limits
- Minimum stake: 1 PIRGS
- Maximum stake: 1,000,000 PIRGS
- Maximum total rewards: 250B PIRGS

### Security Features

- Two-step ownership transfer with 7-day timelock
- Emergency mode with secure withdrawal process
- Protected staked tokens recovery system
- Comprehensive stake validation
- Time-based restrictions

## Functions

### User Functions
- `stake(uint256 amount, StakeDuration duration)`: Stake tokens
- `unstake(uint256 stakeIndex)`: Unstake tokens and claim rewards
- `emergencyWithdraw(uint256 stakeIndex)`: Withdraw stake without rewards (emergency mode only)
- `getUserStakes(address user)`: View all stakes for a user
- `getPendingRewards(address user, uint256 stakeIndex)`: Check pending rewards

### Admin Functions
- `enableEmergencyMode()`: Enable emergency mode
- `disableEmergencyMode()`: Disable emergency mode
- `recoverERC20()`: Recover accidentally sent tokens
- `initiateOwnershipTransfer()`: Start ownership transfer
- `completeOwnershipTransfer()`: Complete ownership transfer
- `renounceOwnershipPermanently()`: Permanently renounce ownership
