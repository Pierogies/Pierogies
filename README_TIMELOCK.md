# CreatorTimelock Smart Contract

## Overview
The CreatorTimelock contract is designed to lock BEP20 tokens for a predetermined period (10 years) before allowing withdrawal by a designated creator address. This contract is specifically built to manage creator token allocations with strong security measures and no administrative privileges.

## Features
- **10-year Timelock**: Tokens are locked for exactly 10 years from contract deployment
- **One-time Funding**: Contract can only be funded once with 10% of total token supply
- **Trustless Design**: No administrative functions or privileged roles
- **Security Focused**: Implements multiple security measures and checks

## Contract Details
- **License**: MIT
- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.26
- **Token Standard**: BEP20

## Core Functions

### Constructor
```solidity
constructor(IBEP20 _token, address _creator)
```
- Initializes the contract with the token address and creator address
- Performs initial token transferability check
- Sets the release time to 10 years from deployment

### Fund
```solidity
function fund(uint256 totalSupply) external nonReentrant
```
- Allows one-time funding of the contract
- Locks 10% of the total token supply
- Includes allowance and balance verification checks

### Release
```solidity
function release() external nonReentrant
```
- Allows creator to withdraw tokens after timelock period
- Can only be called once
- Includes multiple security checks and balance verification

### View Function
```solidity
function getRemainingLockedTokens() external view returns (uint256)
```
- Returns the current balance of locked tokens

## Security Features

### Reentrancy Protection
- Implements nonReentrant modifier on critical functions
- Follows Check-Effects-Interactions pattern

### Token Transfer Safety
- Pre and post balance checks
- Transfer success verification
- Token transferability testing during deployment

### Access Control
- No owner or admin privileges
- Only creator can release tokens after timelock
- One-time funding mechanism

### Input Validation
- Zero-address checks
- Amount validation
- State checks

## Events
1. `TokensFunded(uint256 amount, address funder)`
2. `TokensReleased(uint256 amount, uint256 releaseStage)`
3. `TransferFailed(address intended_recipient, uint256 amount)`

## Usage

### Deployment
1. Deploy contract with token address and creator address:
```solidity
new CreatorTimelock(tokenAddress, creatorAddress)
```

### Funding
1. Approve contract to spend tokens
2. Call fund function with total supply:
```solidity
contract.fund(totalSupply)
```

### Token Release
1. After 10 years, creator calls release:
```solidity
contract.release()
```

## Security Considerations
- Contract is immutable after deployment
- No emergency withdrawal functions
- No admin privileges
- Verify token contract implementation before use
- Check token transferability and potential transfer restrictions

## Requirements
- BEP20 token with standard interface implementation
- Token must be transferable
- Token should not have transfer restrictions or fees

## Audit Status
- Contract has been audited and security issues have been addressed
- Key fixes implemented for:
  - Reentrancy protection
  - Access control
  - Token transfer safety
  - State management
  - Input validation

## Development
- Built with Solidity 0.8.26
- Uses SafeMath by default (Solidity >=0.8.0)
- Follows best practices for smart contract development
